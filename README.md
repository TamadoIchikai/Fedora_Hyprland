# Why i switch from sway -> hyprland
- The reason why i switch to a tiling Window Manager (WM) is because it is very convinient and make sense to me much more than simple floating window manager. Sway/I3 is a very stable WM but it is a manual tiling WM, i know there're scripts to have an automatic layout but those i found isn't good enough. First tiling WM i used was PopOS!, their automatic tiling WM was very good and stable, i intended to move to Cosmic desktop when it finally stable but it took too long, so i make my own hyprland setup with some of my favourite apps.

# When first booting into fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install neovim git zsh
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- -b /usr/local/bin
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/TamadoIchikai/Fedora_Hyprland
chsh -s $(which zsh)
